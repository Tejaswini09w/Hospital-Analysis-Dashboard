## 🧱 Dashboard Structure

The dashboard consists of the following pages:

| Page           | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Overview**   | Summary of all KPIs, trends, and navigation buttons |
| **Patient**    | Patient profiles, filters by age/gender, feedback and ratings |
| **Doctor**     | Appointment insights, doctor ratings, specialty filters |
| **Finance**    | KPI cards, revenue vs. expense tables, margin trends |
| **Hospital**   | Surgery status, room availability, test results, age-wise distribution |
